ML Text Detection project, set up with collaborative engineering and product manager workflows in mind:

***

# ML Text Detection from Images & Documents

## Overview

This project enables **automatic detection and extraction of text** from images, scanned documents, and PDFs using machine learning. It delivers core capabilities for document digitization, content search, and data extraction, supporting business workflows and automation.

## Key Features

- Detects printed and handwritten text in images and scanned documents
- Supports multiple file formats: JPEG, PNG, PDF
- Modular ML pipeline: preprocessing, model inference, postprocessing
- REST API for real-time or batch text extraction
- Sample datasets and inference scripts included
- Extensible architecture for new models, datasets, and downstream tasks

## Use Cases

- Document digitization for enterprises
- Searchable archives from scanned PDFs/images
- Automated data entry from invoices, forms, contracts
- Enhanced accessibility for images/documents
